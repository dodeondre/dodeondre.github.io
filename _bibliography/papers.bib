  abstract={We developed and clinically validated PrecisionPro Fusion, an automated pipeline for MRI-CT image registration in prostate radiotherapy. By replacing manual, error-prone alignment processes with a Python/MATLAB-based framework, we reduced processing time to under 15 minutes while maintaining sub-millimeter accuracy. This system facilitates the clinical deployment of focal radiation therapy boosts by ensuring high-precision targeting across heterogeneous hardware.}

  abstract={This multi-center study analyzed 1,890 patients across seven institutions to evaluate the robustness of RSIrs as a cancer biomarker. Using multivariate linear mixed-effects models, we demonstrated that the RSIrs metric remains resilient against hardware variations and demographic confounders including age, race, and ethnicity. The findings support RSI as a reliable quantitative tool for large-scale clinical implementation in diverse patient populations.}
