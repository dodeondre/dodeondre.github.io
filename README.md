I am a PhD student in Bioengineering at UC San Diego, working in the Seibert Lab. My research is centered on medical imaging and its application in oncology, specifically regarding prostate cancer detection and treatment.

### Research and Focus

My primary work involves using Restriction Spectrum Imaging (RSI) to develop quantitative MRI biomarkers. The goal is to create objective tools that help clinicians differentiate between indolent and aggressive disease. I also work on the technical side of radiotherapy, specifically developing and validating automated MRI-CT registration pipelines like PrecisionPro Fusion to improve the accuracy of treatment planning.

Most of my projects involve taking complex imaging physics and translating them into software or workflows that can be reliably used in a clinical setting.

### Portfolio Content

This repository contains the code for my personal website. I use the site to keep an updated record of my work, including:

- **Publications:** Peer-reviewed journals and conference proceedings focused on medical physics and imaging.
- **Projects:** Technical breakdowns of the registration pipelines and imaging tools I have built.
- **CV:** A summary of my academic and professional experience in bioengineering.
