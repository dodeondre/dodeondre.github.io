I am thrilled to announce that I have officially defended my doctoral dissertation, **"Advanced Diffusion-Weighted MRI for Prostate Cancer Detection and Treatment Planning,"** at the University of California, San Diego. 

The past four years have been a journey of rigorous research, from harmonizing data across 16 different MRI scanners to validating RSIrs as a robust cancer biomarker. I am incredibly grateful to my advisors and colleagues at the Center for Multimodal Imaging & Genetics for their support.

As I transition from my PhD, I am excited to apply my background in statistical modeling and computer vision to new challenges in the tech industry and my own entrepreneurial ventures.

Stay tuned for more updates on my next steps!
