I am happy to share that our latest work, **"PrecisionPro Fusion: Clinical Validation of an Automated MRI-CT Fusion System,"** has been published in *TipsRO*.

In this study, we addressed a critical bottleneck in physician workflows: the manual alignment of multi-modal imaging data. By engineering an automated Python/MATLAB pipeline, we:

- Reduced processing time from hours to under **15 minutes**.
- Achieved sub-millimeter accuracy validated on 20 clinical cases.
- Transitioned the project from a research R&D phase to a clinical deployment.
