I am a Bioengineering PhD candidate at the **University of California, San Diego**, where I specialize in the intersection of Computer Vision, medical imaging, and data science. My academic mission is centered on improving imaging technology to directly enhance patient care and improve the lives of others.

My research focuses on developing advanced diagnostic tools, specifically using **Diffusion-Weighted MRI** for prostate cancer detection. I recently led a multi-center study involving 1,890 patients to validate the RSIrs biomarker, achieving an AUC of 0.77—significantly outperforming current clinical standards. Beyond biomarker validation, I am passionate about automation; I developed **PrecisionPro Fusion**, a Python/MATLAB pipeline that reduces MRI-CT registration time to under 15 minutes with sub-millimeter accuracy.

### Research & Vision

My academic interests lie in:

- **Computer Vision for Social Impact:** Engineering automated diagnostic tools to increase healthcare accessibility.
- **Advanced Imaging:** Exploring the hardware-software co-design of next-generation imaging technology.

### Beyond the Lab

In addition to my research, I am a part-time business owner and the founder of DeckBuilder Trading Card Games, a hobby store built to help collectors liquidate and build their trading card collections. By leveraging PyTorch and Computer Vision, I am building tools to automate inventory management and financial tracking for the hobbyist community.

When I am not processing DICOM data, you can find me exploring the latest in video games, studying strategic business management, or experimenting with new skills like video editing or 3D modeling.

I am always open to collaborations at the intersection of AI, Bioengineering, and Entrepreneurship. Feel free to reach out via email or connect with me on LinkedIn.
